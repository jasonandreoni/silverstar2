    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>How do I get to Telluride from the airport?</h3>
    <p>We recommend Telluride Express for ground transport to Telluride.  They offer both shared-ride and private shuttles from all regional airports.  Advance reservations required and they prefer to have guests book directly.  Make sure to have your full flight itinerary including flight numbers handy when calling to make a reservation!  www.tellurideexpress.com (888) 212-8294</p>
    <h3>Do I need a car?  How do I get around?</h3>
    <p>One of the charms of Telluride and Mountain Village is its pedestrian nature. Upon arrival you can put down your car keys and enjoy the scenery as you explore the area utilizing the unique public transportation system of free gondolas, shuttle services and pedestrian paths. From all of our vacation rental properties shops, restaurants, and activities are only minutes from your door!  The home’s residence guide will have specific information regarding the best way to get out and about from your particular location.</p>
    <h3>How do I get lift tickets, ski lesson reservations, etc.?</h3>
    <p>It is best to pre-order lift tickets directly thru the Telluride Ski Resort’s web-page.  Ski lessons do not require advance reservations but if visiting during a holiday or spring break time period reservations are a good idea.  This can also be done thru the ski resort’s webpage, or in person at the Ski School office in the main plaza of Mountain Village (under the gondola).</p>
    <h3>Do I need dinner reservations?  What are your top recommendations for restaurants?</h3>
    <p>Telluride and Mountain Village do have a handful of fine dining establishments that require reservations, but overall you will find a very relaxed dining scene with many locales not even accepting reservations!  Top choices for fine dining include Allred’s, New Sheridan Chop House and Cosmopolitan.  Top choices for casual dining include Brown Dog Pizza, Taco del Gnar, RBG, and Tomboy Tavern.</p>
    <h3>Is there a grocery store in Telluride?</h3>
    <p>Yes, there are grocery stores in both downtown Telluride (Clark’s Market) and Mountain Village (Market at Mountain Village).  These are local stores, not large national chain grocers, so selection is smaller and prices are a bit higher.  If driving to Telluride or taking a private shuttle from the airport many people choose to grocery shop in the larger town (Montrose or Durango depending on where you are arriving from).  SilverStar can also provide pre-arrival grocery shopping so that your vacation home is stocked with your favorite items upon arrival.  Please contact guest services for more details.</p>
    <p>A member of our group isn’t skiing.  What else is there to do?</p>
    <p>A ton!  From snowmobile tours to snow biking, ice skating and sledding, there are outdoor activities for non-skiers as well.  If you’ve had your fill of active outdoor pursuits enjoy a spa appointment, perusing the numerous art galleries, the Telluride Historical Museum or a day trip to Ouray or Ridgway for a relaxing soak in the hot springs!</p>
