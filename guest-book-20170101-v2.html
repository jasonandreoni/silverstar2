                            "Let me start by saying that Telluride is one of the most amazing places on earth and the SilverStar staff and accommodations are just what we expected, AMAZING. We stayed in one of SilverStar's signature properties that was located in the Villas at Tristant complex and WOW! The home was a 4-bedroom ski-in-ski-out home with a private hot tub and a full kitchen. My kids loved being able to ski out the back door and my wife loved being able to sit on the decks that have unreal views and enjoy some hot chocolate. The beds were super plush and the home was sparkling clean. These guys really took care of us and I would highly recommend them to anyone that is coming into the Telluride region."

Easy access to all the restaurants and bars in the town. Loved that the condo was right next to Clarkâ€™s Market! The kitchen is well stocked making cooking a breeze. The condo was perfect for our three adult couples but can accommodate more! I may just have to come back with the kids next time."
